# react-boilerplate

A simple boilerplate for your react applications. One of the objective behind using this
to avoid using create-react-app which sometimes causes issues when there is a need to
customize of the things. Apart from that, this saves a lot of time by skipping all the
steps required for setting up a new project.

This boilerplate includes:

- React
- React-router
- Webpack
- Eslint
- Prettier
- Babel
- Tailwindcss

This can be extended very easily and is only meant to give a good start while starting
a new project.
